To do:
For all charts:
> we can get RRI/RP10k by multiplying the percent columns if wanted
> Ability to select stat neighbours to benchmark - need data and a way to select (could do plotly color or just slice entire df)
> whole national charts highlighting stat neighbours, england, region, specific LA
> dropdown slicers: LA, phase type grouping, type of establishment, hospital school?, measure type

Chart pages:
> line chart for england, stat neighbours, specific la showing measures over time 
> vertical bar showing national distribution (remove la names and highlight specifics)
> line chart showing specific la and stat neighbours

Overall:
Refactor data work to datacontainer inc. dropdown choices etc
