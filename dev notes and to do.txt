To do:
For all charts:
> Ability to select stat neighbours to benchmark - need data and a way to select (could do plotly color or just slice entire df) DONE
> whole national charts highlighting stat neighbours, england, region, specific LA DONE
> dropdown slicers: LA, phase type grouping, type of establishment, hospital school?, measure type
> Tables of data
> Number and percent on same page?
> Ability to select different breakdowns eg age, phase, year group etc.

Chart pages:
> line chart for england, stat neighbours, specific la showing measures over time DONE 
> vertical bar showing national distribution (remove la names and highlight specifics) DONE 
> line chart showing specific la and stat neighbours DONE
> Choropleth
> Specifc LA pages


Overall:
Refactor data work to datacontainer inc. dropdown choices etc
see difference between years (percentage change over time)

Potential measures:
> Percentage of change
> comparing placement locations to other LAs
> comparing percentages of primary needs to other LAs
> Where new plans are placed -> where is the pressure
> Within a placement type the distribution of primary needs
